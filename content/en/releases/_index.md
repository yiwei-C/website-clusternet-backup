# Clusternet Releases

Clusternet is maintaining a roughly monthly release cycle.

Clusternet release versions follow [SemVer 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) and expressed in the form X.Y.Z, where X, Y, and Z are non-negative integers. X is the major version, Y is the minor version, and Z is the patch version.
